TODO:
- Naive bayes classifier
- Check offset of data conversion (we should be training to predict the next day not the same day)
- Consider looking back more than one day
  - This could also mean a new dimension per extra day with the per day changes
- Normalise price changes so that they are relative not absolute  
- Consider predicting forward more than one day
- Chart of actual stock price history with shading for whether the up/down predictions were correct
