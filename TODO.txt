TODO:
- Consider whether it makes sense to do random cross validation. This means sometimes future data is being used to predict past data.
- Naive bayes classifier
- Consider looking back more than one day
  - This could also mean a new dimension per extra day with the per day changes
- Normalise price changes so that they are relative not absolute  
- Consider predicting forward more than one day
- Chart of actual stock price history with shading for whether the up/down predictions were correct
